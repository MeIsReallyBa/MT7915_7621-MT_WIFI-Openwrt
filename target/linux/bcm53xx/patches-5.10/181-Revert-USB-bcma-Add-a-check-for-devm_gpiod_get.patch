Subject: [PATCH fix] Revert "USB: bcma: Add a check for devm_gpiod_get"

This reverts commit f3de5d857bb2362b00e2a8d4bc886cd49dcb66db.

That commit broke USB on all routers that have USB always powered on and
don't require toggling any GPIO. It's a majority of devices actually.

The original code worked and seemed safe: vcc GPIO is optional and
bcma_hci_platform_power_gpio() takes care of checking the pointer before
using it.

This revert fixes:
[   10.801127] bcma_hcd: probe of bcma0:11 failed with error -2
